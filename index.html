  <h1>MrLeiricy's Website!</h1>

  <p>
    I'm Collin, a 17-year-old with a serious passion for all things tech. I spend countless hours immersed in the world of computers, and my fascination goes way beyond just using them. I really thrive on understanding the intricate workings of hardware and software. Linux operating systems are my particular forte, and I absolutely love tinkering with different distributions, customizing my setup, and exploring the command line. When I'm not diving deep into the kernel or optimizing my system, I unwind by firing up my favorite games, often finding ways to push the boundaries of gaming on my meticulously configured Linux machine.
